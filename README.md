Description
===========
Ruby scripts that generate model / view / presenter class stubs for C# Presenter First-style application coding.

Motivation
----------
This code was extracted from the Puzzle C# code example illustrating the Presenter First design pattern, found on the [Atomic Object Software Commons](http://atomicobject.com/pages/Software+Commons)
and posted to Github (along with a new MIT license) to empower developers to take the code and run with it freely.
